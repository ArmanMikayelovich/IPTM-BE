#ITPM

##Issue Tracking & Project Management System

IT project management (ITPM) is the process of managing the plan,
 organization, and accountability to achieve information technology goals.
 
  Since the reach of IT spans across most of a business or enterprise,
   the scope of these projects can be large and complex.

The magnitude of IT project management often means that itâ€™s more than just 
applying knowledge, aligning skills, and using regular tools and techniques to drive
 a project to completion.
